- lore pickups are sometimes missing randomized checks - resulting in missing / vanilla items?
Lore Tablet-Path of Pain Entrance at Dirtmouth Stag
Lore Tablet-Greenpath Stag at Shopkeeper's Key
Lore Tablet-Fungal Wastes Hidden at Hidden Station Stag

- Soul Totem, Mask Shards & Vessel Fragments checks are sometimes vanilla? Is this related to the lore issue?
- Actual soul totem(refill) checks are missing


- White Fragments local counter incremenets for no reason? QoL issue maybe?
